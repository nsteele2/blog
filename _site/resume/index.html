<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>I am a recent graduate of the <a href="http://infosci.cornell.edu">Cornell University Information Science</a> program, and now a <a href="https://github.com">professional software engineer</a>, specializing in web technologies. Right now, my hobby passion is <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, an open-source static site generator I am currently maintaining. I have a love-hate relationship with most programming languages, but I have found happy homes in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a> and in <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>. I also use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> regularly, usually in the context of Node.</p>

<p>You can usually find me <a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com">coffee</a> in-hand, humming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KlhlHTE12Q">my latest gospel favourite</a>. If I’m not coding, I’m probably out on <a href="http://parker.vsco.co/grid/tags/thingsyouseeonruns/1">a long run</a>, taking <a href="https://parker.vsco.co">a photo of something pretty</a>, or enjoying a <a href="http://www.augustiner-braeu.de/fileadmin/user_upload/hell.png">delicious German beer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

<h3 id="cornell-university">Cornell University</h3>
<p><em>Ithaca, New York — Information Science ‘14</em></p>

<p>I spent my first year at McGill University in Montréal, Canada, where I studied Linguistics and Political Philosophy. I transferred to Cornell in the Fall of 2011 to pursue a degree in Information Science, where I fostered a passion for programming and figuring out the tough problems in technology policy.</p>

<h3 id="fairport-high-school">Fairport High School</h3>
<p><em>Fairport, New York — Regents Diploma with Honors ‘10</em></p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>As I said, I write software. I write in <strong>Go</strong>, <strong>UNIX/GNU via Bash</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> daily, and store it all in <a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>. I’m proficient in a bunch of other languages and love to learn new ones, but I don’t use them regularly. I learned how to program using Java and PHP, so I would say I know them fairly well.</p>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://goji.io">Goji</a> (a Go library) are my two favourite tools for website
creation. My static sites are tossed behind <a href="http://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a>, because I believe in good memory practices.</p>

<p>I’m concise, task-oriented, and am a lover of IRC/IM for communicating with team
members. I’m a big believer in <strong>asynchronous communication</strong> for discussion and
code review beyond initial planning stages. I like a good challenge.</p>
